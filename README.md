#Project Title: Rural Healthcare Emergency Response Website

Developers: Rishu Nagar, Asmita Sonal, Subhash Kumar Choudhary

Project Overview: The Rural Healthcare Emergency Response Website is designed to provide immediate access to emergency healthcare services for rural communities. With limited medical resources and emergency infrastructure in rural areas, this platform serves as a crucial tool to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers during critical situations.

The website features essential information about emergency services, a contact form for help, and an AI-powered chatbot that assists users with real-time emergency guidance. The chatbot can handle more than 20 common healthcare emergency questions, making it a valuable resource in stressful situations where every second counts.

Key Features:

Homepage: Introduction to the website, with a call-to-action for emergency help.
Chatbot Assistance: An interactive chatbot that can guide users through emergency situations by asking key questions such as:
What is the nature of the emergency? (Accident, Heart Attack, etc.)
Does the user need an ambulance?
Location-based services and suggestions for nearby medical centers.
Basic first-aid guidance and tips for stabilizing a patient before help arrives.

Technologies Used:

Chatbot Implementation: Custom-built using JavaScript to respond to emergency-related queries.
Responsive Design to ensure that the website functions seamlessly across devices and is accessible to rural users with varying levels of internet connectivity.
